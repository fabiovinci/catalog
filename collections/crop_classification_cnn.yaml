Name: Crop Classification CNN
ID: '1'
Description: An example convolutional neural network trained on 7 Sentinel-2 images
  throughout the Dutch growing season, using bands R, G, B, and NIR of each image,
  and ground truth data taken from the Dutch agricultural land registration. All data
  used was from 2018, and the model has been trained to infer 76 different crop types.

CharacteristicsOfInputData: Feature data - 7 Sentinel-2 images, R,G,B,NIR bands,
  representative of the Dutch growing season 2018. The data was in UTM projection
  and only cloud free images have been used. It covered a study area in the North-East
  of the country. Label data - The Dutch agricultural land registration data from
  2018 of the study area has been used as ground truth data. It contains the farm
  parcel boundaries and the planted crops. The full list of crops has been reduced
  to 76 major types that were at least present in the region and thought to be potentially
  recognisable from the feature data. Still, the labels are significantly imbalanced.

BiasesAndEthicalAspects: The crop data (labels) are significantly imbalanced, particularly
  towards grasslands. The trained model is merely a proof of concept and not recommended
  for serious applications or use outside of the study region and/or for years it
  has not been trained for.

DataUsed: The model produces a spatial dataset with the inferred
  crop type as integer index value for each grid cell. The index is sequential and
  can be translated into the actual crop type.
# STAC Custom Extension
Performance: This model is mostly a technological proof of concept and performance
  strongly varies per crop type (30% - 80%). Furthermore it achieves only low IoU
  values and the straight-forward CNN architecture used is not capable of reproducing
  parcel boundaries very well.
